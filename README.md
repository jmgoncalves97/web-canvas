## üöÄ How to Use

Getting started is as simple as adding the script to your HTML file.

1.  Download the `editor.js` file from this repository.
2.  Place the `editor.js` file in your project's folder.
3.  Add the script tag to the end of your `<body>` section in your HTML file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>My Editable Page</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <!-- All your page content goes here -->
    <h1>My Awesome Website</h1>
    <p>This text is now editable!</p>

    <!-- Add the editor script at the very end -->
    <script src="editor.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

That's it! Open your HTML file in a browser, and the editor will be active.
